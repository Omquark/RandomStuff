There appears to be an event reader of sorts at 7E12C1, this is almost always set to 2
You can set this to other values to perform events, but it has to be unset to work correctly
Here are what events I've found
02 - Nothing
04 - Starts an event when first meeting Granny
06 - Shuffle first person to back of party(R button)
8, 10 - Animation plays and freezes, may not freeze under some conditions
0A, 0E - Check drawer, Looks like for a random item, I've found Chkn and 25Z
12 - Drops down as if through a hole to new location
14 - Nina saves the party from the hole animation
16 - Go up steps to new location
18 - Turn into the frog, swaps to 1A after completing
1A - Party acts like the frog (Move two tile, hoping over the first, swim, etc). This will have funky sprites
1C - Riding the whale, you get stuck on land
1E - Rand rolling on the overworld, crash when you hit a wall
20 - Sten Grabbing? Pulls you to a wall and freezes
22 - Sten grabbing. Has some slight delay and pulls you over 2 tiles like sten grabbing a pole
24 - Freezes
26 - Finds item and asks to keep
28 - Turn into the great bird
2A - As the bird flying, crashes when you try to land
2C - Recovery spring
2E - Allows walk through walls, but crashes when you open the menu
38 - Some text shows on screen with spell names, freezes
All others I tested freeze, but may fade to black first. I only tested to 0x50

There's another event reader of sorts at 7E0C8C, but it works differently
7E0C9C Is part of the events holder, as is 8D, both appear to increment at times to signify you are a certain place in the story.
Such that setting 9D to 09 will allow you to walk thgouh Mt. Fubi and rescue Suzy without fighting the harpy sisters,
however, with Mt. Fubi skipped, you can;t get back, the rock never creates a path.
Setting 0A will take Suzy back, and setting to 0B and 8E to 01, Bow will ask to go to sleep to skip to the next day.
I haven't played with all the values or looked as the game progresses, so some of this may be inaccurate.
If you play with it, be patient!
