# Breath of Fire 2 Useful Stuff

It's just a handful of scripts and notes regarding Breath of Fire 2 disassembly, mostly regarding how the ROM is build and designed, and how some functions work.
There is a script as a proof of concept as well with the map pointers, which can be run on the latest [SNES9x Rerecording](https://github.com/gocha/snes9x-rr/releases).

There are a few Game Genie/PAR codes as well I use when I run through the game looking for stuff. You can also visit the [Data Crystal = Breath of Fire II](https://datacrystal.tcrf.net/wiki/Breath_of_Fire_II)
page for more information. I update there as well and it's better explained, these notes are primarily for my use. If you understand them, use them and help out! Disassembling makes my brain hurt...
